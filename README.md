# GoogleSearchSimulator v1
Google's search engine is a powerful tool and I want to create a simulator Google Search Engine Results Page (SERP) using Heap Sort for the following two major features

1. For each search keyword/term, display only the top 10 priority search result items/links based on the PageRank.

2. You have a billion google searches a day, design a data structure which lets you pull out the
 top 10 unique ones at the end of the day.

## What I Learned
- [x] Implemented Max-Heap Priority Queue
  * Max-Heapify()
  * Build-Max-Heap() 
  * Heapsort()
  * Max-Heap-Insert()
  * Heap-Extract-Max ()
  * Heap-Increase-Key()
  * Heap-Maximum()
- [x] Use jsoup Web Crawler to collect research results

## Plan for GoogleSearchSimulator v2
* Improve the performance of the application using BST, Bucket Sort and Quicksort
* Add new features to the app
